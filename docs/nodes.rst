EIDA Nodes
==========

EIDA nodes are data centers that archive data from seismic networks deploying broad-band sensors, short period sensors, accelerometers, infrasound sensors, and other geophysical instruments. Currently ten nodes are contributing data to EIDA. Nine primary nodes have committed resources to support operation and further development. Data access is standardized across EIDA and nodes may provide additional data services.

ODC / KNMI
==========
The ORFEUS Data Center, hosted by KNMI, is a centralized data center within EIDA that archives and exposes waveform data from European networks in particular the Netherlands. Historically all data available through ORFEUS EIDA were archived at ORFEUS Data Center, hence its name. Since 2013 the seismic archive has been federated across multiple data centers and ORFEUS Data Center is responsible for a part of the European Integrated Data Archive.
